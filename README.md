Developed a responsive portfolio application site that ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.  I created the app as a default mobile-first application. 
Updated portfolio that includes 4 links to exemplary assignments to github repos as well as my first project. 
Social media links to facebook and linkedin, as well as pinned repos on my github page.
Resume is linked in the about me page as well as a small introduction.

Developed a responsive portfolio application site that ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.  I created the app as a default mobile-first application. 

There are 3 links that will be the basis for future projects and assignments.  Using bootstrap and semantic html a responsive site was developed including responsive images .  A navbar was used to navigate from link to link.
